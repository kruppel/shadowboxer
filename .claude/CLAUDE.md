# Git commits
When creating git commits, use simple, clean commit messages without any Claude Code attribution, emojis, or co-authorship lines.

- In code, do not leave trailing whitespace.
- Do not include Generated by Claude Code annotation in any pull request description.
- Don't use python3. python is installed with mise. It is available.
- Store the Linear IDs for my user and team for faster calls in the future. I also want these to be used as defaults for team and assignment in the future. Default status should be triage.

# Planning / Research

- Store/write all plans related to research/planning locally in a .claude/plans folder

# Testing

- Bias towards less tests, maximal coverage
- Test public interfaces, unless directed otherwise
