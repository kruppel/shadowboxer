# CLAUDE.md

## General

- Do not use emojis unless explicitly requested.

## Workflow / Project Management

- Store the Linear IDs for my user and team for faster calls in the future. I also want these to be used as defaults for team and assignment in the future. Default status should be triage.

## Planning / Research

- Store/write all plans related to research/planning locally in a .claude/plans folder.
- Use Mermaid syntax for flow charts, data models, and other diagrams.

## Dependencies / Scripts

- Don't use python3. python is installed with mise. It is available.

## Commits / Pull Requests

- When creating git commits, use simple, clean commit messages without any Claude Code attribution, emojis, or co-authorship lines.
- Do not include Generated by Claude Code annotation in any pull request description.
- Bias towards conventional commit style. State the Linear issue as `Refs {issue_id}` in the commit body, if applicable.

## Code Style

- In code, do not leave trailing whitespace.
- Bias towards less verbose logging unless stated otherwise (i.e. stated purpose/goal is clear).
- Do not add comments unless I've asked otherwise. Instead, at turn, share potential areas worth documenting based on complexity or need for additional context.

### TypeScript/React

- Naming convention for event callbacks: use `on${ActionName}` pattern (e.g. `onSubmit`, `onNewThing`, `onMouseEnter`).

### Ruby

- Use an eigen class (`class << self`) when there are multiple class methods. Otherwise, prefer self.{method_name} for single class methods.
- Prefer shorthand hash values where applicable (e.g. `{ key: }` instead of `{ key: key }`).

## Testing

- Bias towards less tests, maximal coverage.
- Test public interfaces, unless directed otherwise.

## Dotfiles

- This repo (`~/.shadowboxer`) is the version-controlled source for dotfiles.
- Edits are made here, then copied to live configs (e.g., `~/.config/nvim/`).
- Before copying to live, check if the live config differs from the repo version. If out of sync, show the diff and ask before proceeding.
- To revert: copy from live config back to the repo, or use git to restore.
